## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

FEM-bench evaluates LLMs through a dual-task approach:
* **Implementation tasks**: Generate correct finite element functions (shape functions, numerical integration, etc.)
* **Test generation**: Write comprehensive pytest tests that validate mathematical properties (partition of unity, interpolation conditions, etc.)

You can think of FEM-Bench as having three parts:
* **The core software**: This contains all logic for loading tasks, generating prompts, evaluating function correctness, and computing benchmark metrics. It is designed to be model-agnostic, reproducible, and modular, enabling consistent evaluation regardless of the LLM used.

* **The LLM API evaluation**: API clients for models like GPT-4, Deepseek, Claude, and Gemini are isolated in a separate module to support easy extension, cleaner testing, and secure handling of API keys. This separation ensures that model-specific logic doesn’t pollute the core benchmarking pipeline and allows offline re-evaluation using saved outputs.

* **Tasks**: Each task defines a reference implementation, test cases, and metadata for both code and test generation. These form the basis for evaluating LLM performance on well-defined FEM-related coding challenges.

A schematic of the FEM-Bench workflow is shown here:

**A major goal of this tool is to make it easy to create and deploy new Tasks, ensuring the system stays relevant and highly extensible.**

## FEM-Bench Setup Instructions <a name="setup"></a>

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (3.11 and 3.12 should work, 3.10 has been tested most extensively)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elejeune11/FEM-bench
   cd fem-bench
   
   # Create virtual environment
   python3.10 -m venv fem_bench_env
   source fem_bench_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # fem_bench_env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   
   # Install package
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   
   # Install required packages for LLM API clients
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import fem_bench; print('FEM-Bench installed successfully')"
   pytest --cov=fem_bench --cov-report=term-missing -v tests/
   ```

**Deactivating Environment**

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf fem_bench_env  # To completely remove
```

### Output Metrics:
* **Function Correctness (✓ = Match)**: Indicates whether each model's generated function produced outputs that exactly matched the reference implementation on all verification inputs.
* **Joint Test Success Rate (%)**: Shows the percentage of model-generated test functions that both (1) passed on the reference implementation and (2) failed on all known-broken implementations. This metric captures tests that successfully distinguish correct from incorrect solutions. *(Note: this does not guarantee comprehensive coverage — only a curated set of failure cases are tested.)*

### How To Run the Pipeline <a name="run_pipeline"></a>

To use the LLM APIs, you must create a `.env` file at the root of your project with your own API keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key_here
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_ai_key_here
```

These keys are **not included** in the repo for security. Each client loads the appropriate key using `dotenv`. Missing keys will raise a clear error during runtime. The current code supports ten models: gemini-3-pro-preview, gemini-2.5-pro, claude-opus-4.5, claude-haiku-4.5, gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, qwen3-coder, qwen3-next-80b, llama-4-maverick, and llama-4-scout. You can modify the code to change this, and you only need to include keys for the models you plan to use.

The `run_pipeline.py` script automates a **full LLM benchmarking cycle**:
1. **Load tasks** from the `tasks/` directory.
2. **Generate prompts** for function and test synthesis, saved to `prompts/`.
3. **Call LLMs** to generate code and test files for each task:
   - Outputs are saved to `llm_outputs/`
   - Skips generation if outputs already exist
4. **Load generated completions** into the evaluation pipeline.
5. **Evaluate generated functions** against reference outputs.
6. **Evaluate generated test files** against correct and intentionally broken implementations.
7. **Aggregate results** and generate a Markdown summary in `results/`.

You can run the full benchmark directly with:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

Outputs will be saved to:
- `llm_outputs/` for model completions
- `results/` for evaluation scores and `evaluation_summary.md`

### User-Facing Pipeline API <a name="pipeline_api"></a>

The table below summarizes all key methods available through the `FEMBenchPipeline` class. These are the only methods needed to run the full benchmark pipeline:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `load_all_tasks()` | Load all tasks from the specified `tasks_dir` and populate the internal registry. |
| `generate_and_save_task_prompts()` | Create and save code-generation prompts (`*_code_prompt.txt`). |
| `generate_and_save_test_prompts()` | Create and save test-generation prompts (`*_test_prompt.txt`). |
| `load_all_llm_outputs(allowed_llms=None)` | Load LLM-generated Python outputs from the output directory. Supports optional LLM filtering. |
| `evaluate_all_llm_outputs()` | Evaluate each LLM-generated function against the task reference function and store match results. |
| `evaluate_all_llm_tests()` | Evaluate LLM-generated test functions by running them against both reference and intentionally incorrect implementations. |
| `compute_aggregate_score()` | Compute summary metrics for each LLM including correctness, test pass rate, and expected failure detection rate. |
| `create_markdown_summary(filename="evaluation_summary.md")` | Write a Markdown report of all results to `results_dir`. |



## Extending to Additional LLMs <a name="other_llms"></a>

This repo is designed with modularity in mind: all model-specific API logic is isolated in the `llm_api/` folder, keeping the core benchmarking pipeline clean and stable.

To change the models used in the benchmark, update the `MODEL_NAMES` list in your pipeline script (e.g., `["gpt-5", "gemini-3-pro-preview", ...]`).

To add a new model:
- Create a new `*_client.py` file in `llm_api/` that defines `call_<model>_for_code()` and `call_<model>_for_tests()`.
- Update `llm_clients.py` to route the new `model_name` string to your client functions.

This setup makes it easy to support new providers, customize request/response handling, and preserve a unified interface for generating both function and test completions.


## Creating New Tasks <a name="new_tasks"></a>

Each task defines a single finite element related computation, including a reference implementation, test cases, and known failure modes. Tasks are modular and self-contained, enabling evaluation of both function generation and test synthesis. Examples include mesh generation, element stiffness assembly, and complete problem solvers. Before creating a new task, we recommend looking at already created tasks as examples.

To create a new task, you can start by copying the template:

```bash
cp task_template.py tasks/my_new_task.py
```

Each task file contains:

- **A reference implementation**: The correct function to be learned or reproduced by the model.
- **Helper functions (optional)**: Dependencies used by the main function, such as shape functions or numerical integrators.
- **Reference verification inputs**: A list of example inputs used to evaluate output correctness.
- **Test functions**: Pytest-style tests designed to check correctness, robustness, and behavior.
- **Expected failure cases**: One or more incorrect implementations that the test functions should catch.
- **Metadata**: Information like task ID, author, creation date, and a short description.

All components are bundled together in a `task_info()` function that returns structured metadata.

### From Task to LLM Prompt <a name="task_to_llm"></a>

Each Task defines a Python function to implement and is automatically converted into two structured prompts: one for function generation, and one for test synthesis. The code-generation prompt includes the target function’s exact signature and docstring, plus any helper functions and import restrictions. The test-generation prompt presents the same function and lists all test functions to implement, along with their names and docstrings.

To add a new Task, you only need to define its metadata, reference implementation, and test cases — the system handles formatting and prompt generation automatically. However, keep in mind that the information included in the function docstring will make it into the prompt.
